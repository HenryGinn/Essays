\section{Conclusion}

Not covered here is the evidence of the suffering and all the other reasons for veganism outside of ethical veganism. Here we signpost and summarise those points, along with expanding further on what the philosophy of veganism entails.

The suffering cannot be understood without seeing it, and if you do not feel comfortable watching a documentary such as Dominion then the point has already been made. Keep in mind while watching that the footage is not cherry-picked and that almost all people willingly fund such suffering and demand it continues. It would be hard to find any justification for what is inflicted on animals in factory farms, yet the anti-vegan must argue that taste pleasure and nutritional convenience alone are sufficient. As an example of the conditions in factory farms, farmers can only spend brief moments inside the large shed where animals are. There is so much ammonia in the air that eye and respiratory problems are still a risk for them even with these precautions. The animals get no respite from this environment.

Each of the following reasons would be enough on their own to justify going vegan.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Climate change: The animal products industry is one of the biggest causes of climate change, and going vegan is one of the highest impact lifestyle changes you can make to lower your carbon footprint.
	\item Pollution: The animal products industry is also responsible for a significant portion of air and water pollution.
	\item Ocean plastic: More than half of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch (three times the size of France) is from fishing nets. The fishing industry is responsible for a large portion of ocean plastic.
	\item Deforestation: Clearing room for animals or crops to feed the animals is the leading cause of deforestation.
	\item Biodiversity: The animal agriculture industry is the leading cause of species loss.
	\item Unsustainability: The earth would need to be three times larger if everyone were to eat the diet of the average American. We already have enough land allocated for food to feed everyone on Earth if they were vegan.
	\item Zoonotic diseases: Thousands of animals in one place in terrible conditions is a perfect storm for creating zoonotic diseases.
	\item Antibiotic resistance: a significant proportion of all antibiotics are used by the animal agriculture industry.
\end{itemize}

You will not beat the argument for veganism on the facts and logic. There are simply too many strong reasons for it, and the negative impact on your life is not enough to counteract them outside of people with extremely restrictive dietary requirements. Upon reading this and watching a documentary of life in factory farms you will no longer be able to claim ignorance. There will be several choices:

\begin{itemize}
	\item The Gymnast: Somehow argue against all the arguments for veganism (good luck).
	\item The Moron: Claim you are correct anyway but without countering any arguments. You will not be able to claim to follow the science or rational argument, and you will be no better than the MAGAs.
	\item The Scumbag: Accept that you should go vegan but continue funding torture and slaughter anyway.
	\item The Complicit: Accept that it is all very bad, but that you going vegan will not change anything.
	\item The Enlighted: Go vegan.
\end{itemize}
